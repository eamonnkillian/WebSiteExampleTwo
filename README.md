WebSiteExampleTwo
=================

A simple website built in HTML5, CSS and a little bit of JQuery as an example of what can be achieved. 
I created this site to showcase for a friend of mine how HTML5, CSS and JQuery are making the web and 
web sites interactive and much more user friendly. The idea was to draw together examples or snippets 
from across the amazing open source community and to utilise those in the context of showing a complete
site as opposed to a point "demo". This is the second website which displays precisely the same information
as its predecessor WebSiteExampleOne juts in a slightly different way.

I've included my key for the Google API call to the map .. Please register with
